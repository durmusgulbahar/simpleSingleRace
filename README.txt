How to use program : 
	1- Run Main and watch the race inside "output.txt".
	2- Race doesn't show in console but in file.

CONS : 
	-I couldn't do more than one player. It is single player.
	-I represents player and obstacle with digits. ( -1 player, 1 obstacle, 0 terrain )
	-I used only arrays.
	-I couldn't implement GUI.
